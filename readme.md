# Ignore Selection Speak.

This add-on adds the current selection to the temporary dictionary, replacing it by an empty string. In this way, the selection will be omitted in speech. Useful for reading texts with repeated or unnecessary words / strings.

The entries added will be deleted when you restart NVDA or deleting the entries in the temporary dictionary.
